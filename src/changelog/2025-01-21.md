### New Features

**Query mapping for snowflake integrations** allows user to map queries for the sphere engine to process.

####  Query mapping for snowflake integrations

When creating a new snowflake integration the user can decide whether to map a single table or a query.

The query mapping process requires that you run a query that selects the desired columns and table. 

**Note**: Sphere will add in a "limit 10" clause at the end of query for the sample data.

<!--TODO: Remove sensitive data from imge above-->

After seeing the sample data, the user can move to mapping the columns of query result. Click on a column to see the options for that specific column. Each desired column needs a type, category, and aggegation type (if applicable). Optionally you can also tag the column.
